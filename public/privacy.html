  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> October 28, 2025</p>

  <p>
    The Trek (“we”, “our”, “us”) operates the fitness tracking app “The Trek”. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect information when you use our app and services, including data accessed from Google Fit.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Data Accessed</h2>
  <p>
    With your explicit consent, The Trek may access the following data types from your Google Fit account:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Step count (number of steps taken)</li>
    <li>Distance walked or run</li>
    <li>Calories burned</li>
    <li>Activity duration and type (e.g., walking, running)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We also collect basic user information you provide when registering (such as your name, email address, and profile photo).
  </p>

  <h2>2. Data Usage</h2>
  <p>
    We use your data solely for the following purposes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>To display accurate fitness insights and progress statistics within the app.</li>
    <li>To generate personalized leaderboards and activity rankings.</li>
    <li>To maintain your account and provide customer support.</li>
    <li>To analyze aggregated, anonymized data for improving app performance and features.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We do not use your data for advertising or any purpose unrelated to the app’s functionality.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    The Trek does <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or trade your personal or Google Fit data. Limited data may be shared only with trusted service providers that help us operate the app, such as hosting and database providers, and only as necessary to perform those services.
  </p>
  <p>
    Data is never shared with third parties for marketing or analytics unrelated to The Trek.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Data Storage & Protection</h2>
  <p>
    User data (such as email, profile information, and activity summaries) is securely stored in a PostgreSQL database hosted by Render. Data transmitted between The Trek and Google Fit is encrypted using HTTPS and OAuth 2.0 protocols.
  </p>
  <p>
    We implement strict technical and organizational safeguards to prevent unauthorized access, loss, or alteration of your information.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Data Retention & Deletion</h2>
  <p>
    We retain user account data only as long as your account remains active. You can delete your account or request deletion of all stored data by contacting us at
