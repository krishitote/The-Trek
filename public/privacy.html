  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> October 28, 2025</p>

  <p>
    The Trek (“we”, “our”, “us”) operates the fitness tracking app “The Trek”. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your information when you use our app and services, including data accessed from Google Fit through OAuth 2.0.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information We Access</h2>
  <p>
    With your explicit consent, The Trek may access the following data from your Google Fit account:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Step count (number of steps taken)</li>
    <li>Distance walked or run</li>
    <li>Calories burned</li>
    <li>Activity duration and type (e.g., walking, running)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We also collect limited user information you provide when registering (such as your name, email address, and profile photo).
  </p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>
    The Trek uses your information solely for:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Displaying accurate fitness insights and daily statistics</li>
    <li>Generating leaderboards and ranking users based on activity</li>
    <li>Providing support and maintaining your account</li>
    <li>Improving app performance and functionality using aggregated, anonymized data</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>We do not use your Google Fit data for advertising, marketing, or unrelated analytics.</strong>
  </p>

  <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>We do not sell or share your Google Fit or personal data with any third parties.</strong>
    Data may only be shared with trusted service providers that help us operate the app (for example, hosting and database services), and only to the extent necessary for them to perform their function.
  </p>
  <p>
    All such service providers are bound by strict confidentiality and data protection agreements.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Data Storage & Protection</h2>
  <p>
    Your data is securely stored in a PostgreSQL database hosted by Render. We use industry-standard encryption (HTTPS, SSL/TLS) for all data in transit and implement strict access control measures.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Google Fit data is never stored permanently on our servers.</strong> Only processed summaries or aggregated statistics are retained to display leaderboards and activity trends.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Data Retention & Deletion</h2>
  <p>
    We retain your personal information only while your account remains active. You can request full deletion of your data at any time by emailing us at 
    <a href="mailto:thetrekkenya@gmail.com">thetrekkenya@gmail.com</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once a deletion request is received, all related personal and fitness data will be permanently removed from our servers within seven (7) business days.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Revoking Access to Google Fit</h2>
  <p>
    You can revoke The Trek’s access to your Google Fit data at any time via your Google Account permissions page:
    <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions" target="_blank">https://myaccount.google.com/permissions</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Data Transfer</h2>
  <p>
    We do not transfer your personal or Google Fit data across borders or to third parties outside our infrastructure. All processing occurs on servers managed within secure cloud environments.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The Trek is not intended for users under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect or store data from children under this age. If we discover that a child’s data has been collected, it will be deleted immediately.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Policy Updates</h2>
  <p>
    We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect improvements or changes in how we handle data. The updated version will always be posted here with a revised “last updated” date.
  </p>
