  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> October 28, 2025</p>

  <p>
    The Trek (“we”, “our”, “us”) operates the fitness tracking app “The Trek”. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information when you use our app and services.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We collect the following types of information to provide and improve our services:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> Name, email address, and profile photo.</li>
    <li><strong>Fitness Data:</strong> Steps, distance covered, and activity duration (via Google Fit API, with your consent).</li>
    <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Device type, operating system, and app usage statistics.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To provide and improve app features, including fitness insights and progress tracking.</li>
    <li>To personalize your user experience and display accurate data on your dashboard.</li>
    <li>To communicate important updates, changes, or issues related to the app.</li>
    <li>To maintain the security and integrity of your account.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How We Store and Protect Data</h2>
  <p>
    We store your account data securely in our PostgreSQL database hosted on Render. Fitness data obtained from Google Fit is not stored permanently — it is only accessed temporarily to display insights. 
  </p>
  <p>
    We implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your personal data from unauthorized access, alteration, or loss.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or trade your data to third parties.</li>
    <li>We may share minimal data with trusted service providers who assist in operating the app (e.g., hosting providers).</li>
    <li>We may disclose information if required by law or to protect our legal rights.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Google Fit Data</h2>
  <p>
    The Trek integrates with Google Fit to access fitness data such as steps, activity duration, and calories burned. Access is only granted with your explicit consent through Google’s OAuth system. You can revoke access at any time via your Google Account permissions page.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    We retain user account information as long as your account is active. You may delete your account and associated data at any time by contacting us at <a href="mailto:thetrekkenya@gmail.com">thetrekkenya@gmail.com</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>
    You have the right to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Access the data we hold about you.</li>
    <li>Request correction or deletion of your personal information.</li>
    <li>Withdraw consent for data access (e.g., Google Fit) at any time.</li>
